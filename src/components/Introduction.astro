      I'm Rok Ajdnik, a software engineer whose journey began with coding books in elementary school, 
      building simple websites and desktop tools. That early curiosity evolved through university where 
      I developed web frameworks, into co-founding startups as a technical leader. Today, I'm a 
      Director of Software Engineering at Plume, specializing in APIs.

      In my free time, I tinker with projects exploring software engineering and electronics. 
      When I'm away from the keyboard, you'll find me SCUBA diving and exploring underwater wrecks.
